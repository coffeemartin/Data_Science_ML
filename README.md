By using crime raw dataset, performed data cleaning, transformation and build unsupervised machine learning model with Python, performed descriptive data analysis with Power BI. 

Summary :
Overall, crime against property has shown significant increase since Covid started, the burglary crime rate has been tripled in Newman from FY 2020 – FY 2022.

•	For crime against property: 
Monday from 8:00 am – 3:00 pm, is when the crime most likely to happen.
